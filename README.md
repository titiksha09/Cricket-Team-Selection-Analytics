🎯 Project Objective

Build a cricket team optimized for scoring and defending.

Classify players into roles: Openers, Anchors, Finishers, All-Rounders, Fast Bowlers.

Use statistical criteria (Batting Avg, Strike Rate, Boundary %, Bowling Economy, Dot Balls, etc.) to guide selection.

Let users interactively pick their Final XI in a dashboard while maintaining team balance.
